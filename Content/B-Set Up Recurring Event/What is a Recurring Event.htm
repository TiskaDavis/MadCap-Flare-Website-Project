        <h1>What is a Recurring Event?</h1>
        <p>This section provides information about what a recurring event is.</p>
        <p>A <b>recurring event</b> is an event that repeats at regular intervals over time, eliminating the need to create separate entries for each occurrence manually. Recurring events are commonly used for activities or commitments that follow a predictable schedule, such as weekly meetings, monthly appointments, or daily reminders. The calendar allows you to set the frequency of repetition, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Daily: The event repeats every day.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Weekly: The event occurs on the same day(s) each week.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Monthly: The event repeats on a specific date or day of the month.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Yearly: The event occurs annually on the same date.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Custom: Users can define specific intervals (e.g., every 2 weeks or every 3 months).</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can set an end date for the recurring series (e.g., "Repeat until December 31, 2024") or choose to repeat indefinitely.</p>
