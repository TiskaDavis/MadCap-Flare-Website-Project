        <h1>What is a Calendar Event?</h1>
        <p>This section provides information about what an event is.</p>
        <p>A <b>calendar event</b> is a digital entry used to organize and schedule activities or reminders. Events typically include essential details to help manage time effectively. Below are the key components of a calendar event:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b>Start Time:</b> The exact time when the event begins (e.g., 10:00 AM).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>End Time:</b> The exact time when the event concludes (e.g., 11:00 AM).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Event Title:</b> A short, descriptive name for the event (e.g., "Team Meeting" or "Doctor's Appointment"). The title helps identify the event's purpose at a glance in the calendar view.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Location:</b> Specifies where the event will take place (e.g., "Room 101," "Zoom Link," or "Central Park"). Adding a location is especially useful for meetings, appointments, or events with attendees, as it provides clarity about the venue.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
